# Jam Board

Jam Board is a work management application built with **Next.js** (App Router) for the frontend, and **Node.js** for the backend. It allows users to create boards, manage work items, and update their status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, In QA, Done). Users can also register, log in, and track their work items.

This README will guide you through the process of setting up your development environment.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version >=16.x)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) (for local development)

## Setting Up the Development Environment

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jam-board.git
cd jam-board
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies for both the frontend and backend using Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

This will install dependencies for both the **client** (frontend) and **server** (backend) directories.

### 3. Setup Environment Variables

Create `.env` files in both the root of the project and the `server/` directory to store sensitive environment variables, such as database credentials and JWT secrets.

#### `.env` (Root Directory)

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000   # URL for the backend API
```

#### `.env` (Server Directory)

```env
DB_URL=sqlite:./dev.sqlite3               # SQLite database connection string
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret                # Secret for signing JWT tokens
```

> You can adjust `DB_URL` to point to a different database if needed (e.g., PostgreSQL). This project is currently using **SQLite**.

### 4. Run the Application

#### Start Both Backend and Frontend

To start both the frontend and backend in development mode, we use `concurrently` to run both apps simultaneously.

Run the following command from the root directory:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will:

- Start the **frontend** (Next.js) on `http://localhost:3000`
- Start the **backend** (Express/Node.js) on `http://localhost:5000`

Now you can access the app at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Backend Setup

### Database

This project uses **Sequelize** with **SQLite** by default for local development, but the architecture allows easy migration to **PostgreSQL** later. The database models include **User**, **Board**, and **WorkItem**.

To sync the database and create the necessary tables, run the following command:

```bash
yarn db:migrate
```

This will create the tables defined in your Sequelize models.

## Database Setup

- The database used is **SQLite** for local development, defined in the `server/config/db.ts` file. If you want to migrate to **PostgreSQL**, you can modify the database connection URL in the `.env` file and update the Sequelize configurations accordingly.

To reset and recreate the database tables (use with caution in production), run:

```bash
yarn db:reset
```

This will drop the tables and re-sync them.
